# Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Gemini Keyboard project. The project is a web-based application that displays a virtual keyboard and shows the corresponding 2-byte USB HID keycode when a key is clicked.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1. Virtual Keyboard Display

*   The application shall display a visual representation of a standard 104-key English (QWERTY) keyboard.
*   The keyboard layout shall include all standard keys: alphanumeric, function keys, modifier keys, navigation keys, and numpad.

### 2.2. User Interaction

*   The user shall be able to click on any key of the virtual keyboard using a mouse.
*   When a key is clicked, the application shall provide a visual feedback to indicate that the key has been pressed (e.g., by changing the key's color or style).

### 2.3. Keycode Display

*   Upon clicking a key, the application shall display the corresponding 2-byte USB HID keycode.
*   The keycode shall be displayed in a designated area at the top of the screen.
*   The keycode format shall be in hexadecimal (e.g., 0x04 for the 'a' key).

### 2.4. Keycode Mapping

*   The application shall maintain a mapping of all virtual keys to their respective USB HID keycodes.
*   The keycode mapping shall be based on the official USB HID Usage Tables documentation.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Technology Stack

*   The application shall be built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
*   No external libraries or frameworks shall be used.

### 3.2. Browser Compatibility

*   The application shall be compatible with the latest versions of modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### 3.3. User Interface

*   The user interface shall be clean, simple, and intuitive.
*   The keyboard layout shall be clear and easy to read.

## 4. Project Scope

*   The initial version of the project will only support a standard English (QWERTY) keyboard layout.
*   Support for other keyboard layouts or languages is out of scope for the initial version.
*   The application will not simulate actual keyboard input to the operating system.
